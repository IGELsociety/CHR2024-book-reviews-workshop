Workshop hosted at CHR 2024.\"\n---\n\n\n## Workshop Description\n\n### Aims and Setup\n\nAddressing the great relevance of cultural practices in the digital sphere, the proposed workshop will pursue a multilingual investigation of fiction book reviewing. The idea is to give participants a hands-on experience of the full workflow involved when doing research on reader response using book reviews and online comments as a proxy of reception. Data will be provided and each part of the workshop will cover different stages of the research workflow, addressing theoretical, methodological, and interpretative challenges.\nParticipants will learn from experienced scholars how to do computational reader response studies with advanced NLP methods, statistical modelling,  and a sensibility for handling both literary works and social media data.  We propose a full day workshop consisting of 4 sessions.\nThe workshop is particularly addressed at early career researchers who want to have an end-to-end overview of a computational humanities project or are interested in reader response. However, senior researchers are very welcome to attend and discuss theory, operationalization of concepts, and methodological choices.\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- Participants will develop a deeper understanding of the theoretical and methodological issues related to the computational analysis of literary texts and reader response data.\n- Participants will have a collection of Jupyter notebooks that they can reuse for their own research.\n- The organizers will receive feedback on the perceived validity of the tools and methods used.\n\n### Background\n\nReading books and communicating about them is one of the ways people have long been reflecting on life and values, playing with alternative ideas, regulating emotions, and enjoying aesthetic pleasure. They also relate to each other through these practices: intellectually, communicatively and emotionally. Today, book reception practices have become digital at an unprecedented scale: millions of readers interact with each other on digital reviewing platforms [^1].\nWhile collections of printed books have been developed and maintained for centuries, archives of ordinary readers’ responses to books have rarely been preserved. Due to a lack of empirical and historical research evidence, many aspects of readership and reception history remained theoretical and/or anecdotal until the 21st century. In the last two decades, researchers have been uncovering historical archives [^2] and developing contemporary book reception corpora in support of empirical investigations in reading behavior, reader response, reception, literary appreciation, etc. [^3] [^4] [^5]. User-generated book reviews on social reading/reviewing websites such as Amazon and Goodreads meet this need, and have opened up unprecedented research possibilities to study what people feel and think about the books they read and how they share their reading experiences with others. This information available online offers several opportunities: readers can more easily socialize with people having similar interests, libraries can make better informed decisions when providing services to their patrons, publishers can get insight about their readership and tailor their editorial and marketing strategies, booksellers can develop more accurate recommender systems, and new business models have been created by platforms that offer successful content to media industries like Netflix.\nDuring this workshop, on the one hand, we will discuss theoretical approaches to model book reviewing and book reception across different global and cultural spheres; on the other hand, we illuminate which methodologies need to be developed in between ‘close reading’ of individual reviews and computational analysis of thousands of reviews.\n\n[^1]: S.

He is the Principal Investigator of the ERC Starting Grant project [GOLEM (Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models)](https://golemlab.eu). He is the author of the book [*Digital Social Reading: Sharing Fiction in the 21st Century*](https://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/book/9780262550918) (MIT Press, 2024). \n\n\n## Tutorial Content\n\n- [0: Packages and Data](packages-and-data.html). Some instructions on the packages and data sets used in the workshop. It would be handy to read this before the workshop starts!\n- [1: Hello Arrow](hello-arrow.html). The first session of the workshop provides an overview of the Apache Arrow project and gives participants their first hands on experience working with data using Arrow. \n- [2: Data Wrangling](data-wrangling.html). The second session is a deep dive into the analyzing large data sets using **arrow**, **dplyr**, and to a lesser extent **duckdb**. This is the longest session of the workshop.\n- [3: Data Storage](data-storage.html). The third session looks in detail the read/write capabilities of **arrow**. It discusses the parquet file format, how to use it effectively for large data sets, and how to partition large data sets across many files.\n- [4: Advanced Arrow](advanced.html). The final session is brief, and takes a look under the hood. It talks about the data structures and data types used in Arrow.\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\nadd info about the setup (Google Colab)\n\n## When/Where\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nworkshop_time <- function(tz) {\n  start <- lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2024-12-03 09:00:00\", tz = \"Europe/Copenhagen\")\n  close <- lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2024-12-03 17:00:00\", tz = \"Europe/Copenhagen\")\n  cat(\"Time zone:\", tz, \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"  start time:\", lubridate::with_tz(start, tz) |> as.character(), \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"  close time:\", lubridate::with_tz(close, tz) |> as.character(), \"\\n\")\n}\n\nworkshop_time(\"Europe/Copenhagen\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTime zone: Europe/Copenhagen \n  start time: 2024-12-03 09:00:00 \n  close time: 2024-12-03 17:00:00 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# workshop_time(\"US/Pacific\")\n# workshop_time(\"US/Eastern\")\n# workshop_time(\"Australia/Sydney\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nCHR 2024\nFIFTH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL HUMANITIES RESEARCH\n\nAarhus University, Denmark\n",
