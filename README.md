# Computational Analysis of Multilingual Book Reviews

This repository contains source code and data for the Computational Analysis of Multilingual Book Reviews workshop run as part of the CHR 2024 Conference. 

The repository contains almost everything you need for the workshop. However, it does not include a copy of the data sets due to copyright issues. 

A sample of the data will be provided during the workshop. The full dataset will also be published later in an institutional repository and made available for research purposes.
