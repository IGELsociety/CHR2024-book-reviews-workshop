title: "Computational Analysis of Multilingual Book Reviews"

## Workshop Description

### Aims and Setup

Addressing the great relevance of cultural practices in the digital sphere, the proposed workshop will pursue a multilingual investigation of fiction book reviewing. The idea is to give participants a hands-on experience of the full workflow involved when doing research on reader response using book reviews and online comments as a proxy of reception. Data will be provided and each part of the workshop will cover different stages of the research workflow, addressing theoretical, methodological, and interpretative challenges.
Participants will learn from experienced scholars how to do computational reader response studies with advanced NLP methods, statistical modelling,  and a sensibility for handling both literary works and social media data.  We propose a full day workshop consisting of 4 sessions.
The workshop is particularly addressed at early career researchers who want to have an end-to-end overview of a computational humanities project or are interested in reader response. However, senior researchers are very welcome to attend and discuss theory, operationalization of concepts, and methodological choices.

### Expected Outcomes

- Participants will develop a deeper understanding of the theoretical and methodological issues related to the computational analysis of literary texts and reader response data.
- Participants will have a collection of Jupyter notebooks that they can reuse for their own research.
- The organizers will receive feedback on the perceived validity of the tools and methods used.

### Background

Reading books and communicating about them is one of the ways people have long been reflecting on life and values, playing with alternative ideas, regulating emotions, and enjoying aesthetic pleasure. They also relate to each other through these practices: intellectually, communicatively and emotionally. Today, book reception practices have become digital at an unprecedented scale: millions of readers interact with each other on digital reviewing platforms [^1].
While collections of printed books have been developed and maintained for centuries, archives of ordinary readers’ responses to books have rarely been preserved. Due to a lack of empirical and historical research evidence, many aspects of readership and reception history remained theoretical and/or anecdotal until the 21st century. In the last two decades, researchers have been uncovering historical archives [^2] and developing contemporary book reception corpora in support of empirical investigations in reading behavior, reader response, reception, literary appreciation, etc. [^3] [^4] [^5]. User-generated book reviews on social reading/reviewing websites such as Amazon and Goodreads meet this need, and have opened up unprecedented research possibilities to study what people feel and think about the books they read and how they share their reading experiences with others. This information available online offers several opportunities: readers can more easily socialize with people having similar interests, libraries can make better informed decisions when providing services to their patrons, publishers can get insight about their readership and tailor their editorial and marketing strategies, booksellers can develop more accurate recommender systems, and new business models have been created by platforms that offer successful content to media industries like Netflix.
During this workshop, on the one hand, we will discuss theoretical approaches to model book reviewing and book reception across different global and cultural spheres; on the other hand, we illuminate which methodologies need to be developed in between ‘close reading’ of individual reviews and computational analysis of thousands of reviews.
