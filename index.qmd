## Tutorial Content

- [0: Packages and Data](packages-and-data.html). Some instructions on the packages and data sets used in the workshop. It would be handy to read this before the workshop starts!
- [1: Hello Arrow](hello-arrow.html). The first session of the workshop provides an overview of the Apache Arrow project and gives participants their first hands on experience working with data using Arrow. 
- [2: Data Wrangling](data-wrangling.html). The second session is a deep dive into the analyzing large data sets using **arrow**, **dplyr**, and to a lesser extent **duckdb**. This is the longest session of the workshop.
- [3: Data Storage](data-storage.html). The third session looks in detail the read/write capabilities of **arrow**. It discusses the parquet file format, how to use it effectively for large data sets, and how to partition large data sets across many files.
- [4: Advanced Arrow](advanced.html). The final session is brief, and takes a look under the hood. It talks about the data structures and data types used in Arrow.
